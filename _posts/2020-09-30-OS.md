## Abstraction

- Map
  - CPU --> Threads
  - Memory --> Address space
  - Disk --> File system

- Process

  - Definition: one or more **threads** in an **address space**.

  - Informal definition: a program in execution

- Thread

  - Definition: A sequence of **executing instructions** from a program.

  - Point: active, running instructions

- Address space

  - Definition: All the **memory** data the threads use as they run.

  - Point: passive, acted on by threads.

## Synchronization

- Goals
  - Eliminate interleaving
  - Preserve interleaving

- Type
  - Mutual exclusion (not same time)
    - Critical section: section of code, run atomically w.r.t. other code with shared resource
    - **Mutexes** (Locks): prevent another thread from entering a critical section (with same lock).

    ```c++
    mutex.lock();
    <critical section>
    mutex.unlock();
    ```

  - Ordering constraint (before/after)
    - **Condition variables**: has list of waiting threads
    - `cv::wait(mutex m)`: 
      - unlock
      - add thread to waiting list
      - go to sleep
      - lock after waking

    - `cv::signal()/cv::broadcast()`:
      - wake up one/all waiting thread
    - note: always use `while`:

    ```c++
    mutex.lock();
    while(!condition){
        cv.wait(mutex);
    }
    // do sth
    mutex.unlock()
    ```

- Monitors: Lock + associated CV
  - Mode:

  ```c++
    mutex.lock();
    while(!condition){
        cv.wait(mutex);
    }
    // do sth
    cv.signal() or cv.broadcast();
    mutex.unlock()
  ```

- Design
  - Step 1: Identify **shared state**
  - Step 2: Assign **locks** to shared state
  - Step 3: List **before-after conditions**, assign cv to each condition
    - When wait?

- Reader-writer lock
  - Constraints
    - multiple read if no write
    - write if no read or write

- Semaphores: Generalized `lock() / unlock()`
  - Define as
    - Non-negative integer (user initialized)
    - `down()`: wait for positive, then decrement by 1
    - `up()`: increment by 1

  - Provide **Mutual exclusion** and **Ordering constraints**
    - Mutex: Use binary semaphores, init as 1

    - Ordering: use `down()` to wait until positive (**wait on 0**)

## Per-thread state, switch thread

- Optimization: Thread state
  - registers
  - PC: program counter
  - SP: stack pointer

- State of a thread (from thread point of view)
  - **Running**: on **CPU**
    - to Blocked: call lock(), wait(), down()
    - to Ready: preempted
  - **Blocked**: on **waiting queue**
    - to Ready: another thread call unlock(), signal(), up()
  - **Ready**: on **ready queue**
    - to Running: thread is scheduled

- Thread control block (TCB)
  - Per-thread OS data structure for thread info
  - store **thread context** when thread is not running
    - Thread Identifier: Unique id (tid) is assigned to every new thread
    - Stack pointer: Points to thread's stack in the process
    - Program counter: Points to the current program instruction of the thread
    - State of the thread (running, ready, waiting, start, done)
    - Thread's register values
    - Pointer to the Process control block (PCB) of the process that the thread lives on

- Switching threads (from CPU point of view)
  - Step
    - Current thread **returns control** to OS
    - OS **chooses new thread** to run
    - OS **saves current thread state**: CPU to TCB
    - OS **loads context of next thread**: TCB to CPU
    - OS **runs next thread**

  - return control to OS
    - Internal
      - lock(), wait(), down()
      - yield()
      - require OS

    - External
      - interrupts
  - Implementation of saves and loads
    - `getcontext()`, `setcontext()`, `swapcontext()`

  - Create a new thread
    - `makecontext()`
    - Synchronizing with a child
      - `child.join()` in parent: cause parent to wait for child to finish

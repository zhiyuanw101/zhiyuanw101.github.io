## Lec 1: Course overview + the shell [ðŸ”—](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/course-shell/)

- `echo hello\ world`, `echo "hello world"`: white spaces between arguments
- `sudo su`: start a super user terminal
- `#`: run in super user
- `tee FILE`: write to FILE and stdout
- `xrg-open / open FILE`: open file
- `chmod`:
  - direct mode: `chmod 777 FILE`
    - 4 for read
    - 2 for write
    - 1 for execute
  - symbolic mode: `chmod u+x FILE`
    - mode: clause [, clause ...]
    - clause: [who ...] [action ...] action
    - who: a $\vert$ u $\vert$ g $\vert$ o
    - action: op [perm ...]
    - op: + $\vert$ - $\vert$ =
    - perm: r $\vert$ s $\vert$ t $\vert$ w $\vert$ x $\vert$ X $\vert$ u $\vert$ g $\vert$ o
  - Example:
    - `755`: `u=rwx,go=rx`/ `u=rwx,go=u-w`
- **Shebang**:
  - `#!interpreter [optional-arg]`
  - use `env`
- `cut`:
  - cuts out selected portions of each line (as specified by list) from each file and writes them to the standard output. If file not specified, read from standard input.

## Lec2: Shell Tools and Scripting [ðŸ”—](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/)

### Scripting

- define variables
- strings: `"$foo" / '$foo'`
  - `"$VAR"` will be substituted
- functions:
  - `source mcd.sh`
  - `mcd test`
  - difference with script
- exit code
- `$( CMD )`: *command substitution*, get output of command as variable
- `<( CMD )`: *process substitution*: execute CMD and place the output in a temporary file and substitute the `<()` with that fileâ€™s name.
- for loop:
- if
  - [test](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/test.1.html)
- shell globbing: `mv *.{.py,.sh} FOLDER`
  - Wildcards: `*.py`, `?.sh`
  - Curly braces: `{.png,.jpg}`, `{a..h}`

### Shell tools

- `man` and `tldr`
- `find/ fd/ locate`: find files
- `grep/ rg`: find code
- `history, fzf`: find shell commands
- `tree/ nnn`: Directory Navigation
- `fasd`: Directory Navigation with frequency

### Exercise

1. man ls

    ```sh
    ls -lAaGht
    -A: all except ../ .
    -a: include ../ .
    -G: print color
    -h: use unit suffixes: Byte, KB...
    -t: sort by last modified
    ```

2. marco, polo

    ```sh
    marco () {
        export MCD=$(pwd)
        echo "MCD is set to ${MCD}"
    }

    polo () {
        cd ${MCD}
        echo ${MCD}
    }
    ```

3. random test with counter

    - notice difference between `sh xx.sh/ source xx.sh/ . ./source.sh`
    - notice implementation of [counter](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-script-counter)
    - [if](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/the-unix-shells-humble-if)
    - [comparison, test](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031)
  
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
  
    counter=0
    while true; do
        echo "num: $counter"
        sh random.sh
        if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
            echo random\ script\ exit with error
            break
        fi
        echo random\ script\ run\ successfully
        let counter++
    done
    echo done!
    ```

4. [`xargs`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/xargs.1.html)

    - `xargs`: execute a command using STDIN as arguments
      - `-0`: input null character as a separator
      - `-t`: print command executed
      - `-p`: print command to be execute
      - `-Istr`: replace `str` initial-arguments with names read from standard input.
    - [`find`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html):
      - `find [starting-point...] [expression]`
      - `[expression]`:
        - Tests
          - `-true`: find all
          - `-name PATTERN`
          - `-perm -MODE`/`-perm /MODE`: 
        - Actions
          - `-print`: by default
          - `-print0`
          - `-ok COMMAND`: like `-exec` but ask first
          - `-exec COMMAND`: `{}` replaced by current filename being processed
        - Global options
          - `-maxdepth LEVELS`: Descend at most LEVELS (a non-negative integer)
        - Positional options
        - Operators: often replace `(`, `!` with `\(`, `\!`
          - `( expr )`
          - `! expr`/ `-not expr`
          - `expr1 -a expr2`/ `expr1 -and expr2`/ `expr1 expr2`
          - `expr1 -o expr2`/ `expr1 -or expr2`
      - `-exec`: `{}` as the founded DIR, end with \; or ";"
      - `-print0`: print result followed by a null character, corresponds to the -0 option of xargs.
  
    ```sh
    # GNU find: gfind
    gfind . -name "*.sh" -exec echo {} \; | xargs zip sh.zip 
    gfind . -name "*.sh" -print0 | xargs -0 zip sh.zip
    ```

## Lec 4: Data Wrangling [ðŸ”—](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/data-wrangling/)

### [Regex](https://regexone.com/)

[Regex debugger](https://regex101.com/)

- `.`: any single character
- `\d`: Any digit, `\D`: any none digit
- `\w`: any alphanumeric character, `\W`: any non-alphanumeric character
- `[abc]/ [a-c]`: single character in a,b,c
- `{m}`: m repititions
- `*`: zero or more repititions
- `+`: one or more repititions
- `\s`: any whitespace (space, tab, new line/...), `\S`: any non-whitespace
- `^...&`: start and end of line
- `(...)`: capture group, `(abc|def)`: match abc or def
- `?`: optional character

### Tools

- `sort`
- `awk`
- `paste`
- `wc`
- `R`
- `bc`
- `gnuplot`

### Excerise

1. [Regex](https://regexone.com/)
2. Find the number of words (in `/usr/share/dict/words`) that contain at least three `a`s and donâ€™t have a `'s` ending. What are the three most common last two letters of those words? `sed`â€™s y command, or the `tr` program, may help you with case insensitivity. How many of those two-letter combinations are there? And for a challenge: which combinations do not occur?

  ```sh
 head -n 20 /usr/share/dict/words | \
 tr "[A-Z]" "[a-z]" | \
 sed -E 's/((^(\w*a\w*){3}([^'][a-zA-Z]|[a-zA-Z'][^s])$|^(\w*a\w*){2}(a\w|[a-zA-Z']a)$)|.*)/\2/'
  ```

  ```sh
  cat /usr/share/dict/words | \
  grep '.\+.\+' | \
  sed -E 's/^.*(..)$/\1/' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -nk1,1 | \
  tail -n 3
  ```

  ```sh
  cat /usr/share/dict/words | \
  grep '.\+.\+' | \
  sed -E 's/^.*(..)$/\1/' | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  wc -l
  ```

3. To do in-place substitution it is quite tempting to do something like `sed s/REGEX/SUBSTITUTION/ input.txt > input.txt`. However this is a bad idea, why? Is this particular to `sed`? Use `man sed` to find out how to accomplish this.

  ```sh
  sed -i '' 's/find/replace/g' filename
  ```

4. Find your average, median, and max system boot time over the last ten boots. Use `journalctl` on Linux and `log show` on macOS, and look for log timestamps near the beginning and end of each boot. 

```sh
log show | egrep '=== system boot:|Previous shutdown cause:'
```

## Lec 5: Command-line Environment

#### utils
- [mosh](https://mosh.org/)
- [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs)
### Excercise

1. From what we have seen, we can use some `ps aux | grep` commands to get our jobsâ€™ pids and then kill them, but there are better ways to do it. Start a `sleep 10000` job in a terminal, background it with `Ctrl-Z` and continue its execution with bg. Now use [`pgrep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find its pid and `pkill` to kill it without ever typing the pid itself. (Hint: use the `-af` flags).
2. Say you donâ€™t want to start a process until another completes, how you would go about it? In this exercise our limiting process will always be `sleep 60 &`. One way to achieve this is to use the [`wait`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wait.1p.html) command. Try launching the sleep command and having an `ls` wait until the background process finishes.
However, this strategy will fail if we start in a different bash session, since wait only works for child processes. One feature we did not discuss in the notes is that the kill commandâ€™s exit status will be zero on success and nonzero otherwise. kill -0 does not send a signal but will give a nonzero exit status if the process does not exist. Write a bash function called pidwait that takes a pid and waits until the given process completes. You should use sleep to avoid wasting CPU unnecessarily.


## Lec 4: Git

### Data model

```c++
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parent: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}

// Objects
type object = blob | tree | commit

objects = map<string, object>

// SHA-1 hash for id
def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]

// References
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

### Interface

- `git cat-file -p <hash-id>`: Pretty-print the contents of \<object\> based on its type.

#### Basics

- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the .git directory

- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git log --all --graph --decorate`: visualizes history as a DAG
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git diff <revision> <filename>`: shows differences in a file between snapshots
- `git checkout <revision>`: updates HEAD and current branch
- `git checkout <file>`: discard file changes in workspace

#### Branching and merging

- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to it
  - same as `git branch <name>`; `git checkout <name>`
- `git merge <revision>`: merges into current branch
- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts
- `git rebase`: rebase set of patches onto a new base

#### Remotes

- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local and remote branch
- `git fetch`: retrieve objects/references from a remote
- `git pull:` same as git fetch; git merge
- `git clone`: download repository from remote

#### Undo

- `git commit --amend`: edit a commitâ€™s contents/message
- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file
- `git checkout -- <file>`: discard changes

#### Advanced Git

- `git config`: Git is highly customizable

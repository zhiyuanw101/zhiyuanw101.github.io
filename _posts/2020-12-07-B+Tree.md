## Basics

- Definition: Self balancing structure with multiple element in each node.
- Paramenter:
  - **Height**: length of *any* path from root to leaf, $\log_F{N}$
    - $F$: average fanout
    - $N$: #leaf pages
  - **Order**: $d$, minimum number of entries in all (non-root) nodes
  - $2\cdot$ **Order**: maximum number of entries in all nodes
  - Max **fanout**: $2d +1$
  - Average **fanout**:  $(2d+1)*(\text{fill factor})$
    - average #children for non-leaf node.
- Invariant:
  - Pointer: $K_1 | P | K_2, K_1 \leq V(P) < K_2$
  - Non-root: $d \leq m \leq 2d$
- Note:
  - Each node --> page

## Operations

### Search

- Start from root, traverse down until leaf node is reached.
- Non-leaf node searched using binary/linear search.

### Insertion

- Process:
  - Find position (search)
  - Indert
  - Restore invariant
  - Propagate to parent
- Strategy:
  - split
    - **leaf**: $2d+1$ -> $(d, d+1)$, middle key **copied up** to parent
    - **non-leaf**: middle key **pushed up** to parent
  - re-distribute
    - re-distributing entries with a **sibling**
    - **sibling**: immediately to left or right and same parent
    - usually only for leaf level entries
  - favor merge

### Deletion

- Process
  - Find data entry (search)
  - Delete
  - Restore invariant
  - delete relevent entry in parent
- Strategy:
  - re-distribute
    - borrow from sibling
    - **leaf**: **copied up** middle key
    - **non-leaf**: rotation
  - merge
    - merge with sibling
    - **leaf**: **toss** index entrys
    - **non-leaf**: **pull down** index entrys
  - try re-distribution with all sibling, then merge

### Bulk load

Only for creating index

- advantages
  - fewer I/Os
  - leaves stored sequentially
  - control "fill factor"

- initialization
  - sort all data entries, insert pointer to first (leaf) page in a new (root) page

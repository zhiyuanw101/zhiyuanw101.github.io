## Basic Structure

```Makefile
target: dependencies other_make_targets
    command
    command
    command
```

- **target**
  - file
    - Make sure all the dependencies are up to date
    - If target is older than any dependency, recreate it using the specified commands.
  - phony
    - declare it using `.PHONY: clean` so that make will not check for it's file
- **command** must start with tab.
  - executed as if in different shell
    - `command1; command2`
    - ```command1; \ command2```
    - add `.ONESHELL:`
  - each command will be printed
    - `@command` to stop echo
- **prerequisites** 
  - (dependencies other_make_targets) file names, must exist before target run.
  - dependencies are make in order from left-to-right.
- by default, make target print commands

## Variables and Text Functions (Macros)

### Intro

```Makefile
VAR1="string literal"
VAR2=$(ls *.cpp)

print_vars:
    echo $(VAR1)
    echo $(VAR2)
```

- `$(statement)`: replace statement with the result of evaluating statement between parentheses.

```sh
>> make DEBUG_FLAG=-g
```

- Macros can be defined on the command line.

### Internal Macros

```sh
# displayInternal Macros
>> make -p
```

### Automatic Variables

Automatic variables are set by make after a rule is matched. There include:

- `$@`: the target filename.
- `$*`: the target filename without the file extension.
- `$<`: the first prerequisite filename.
- `$^`: the filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces, discard duplicates.
- `$+`: similar to `$^`, but includes duplicates.
- `$?`: the names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.


### Assignments

```Makefile
# Recursive variable. This will print "later" below
one = one ${later_variable}
# Simply expanded variable. This will not print "later" below
two := two ${later_variable}

later_variable = later

.PHONY: all
all:
    echo $(one)
    echo $(two)
```

- `=` only looks for the variables when the command is used, not when it’s defined.
- `:=` like normal imperative programming – only those defined so far get expanded

### filter-out

```Makefile
THESE=abc def
FROM_THESE=abc def ghi
VAR=$(filter-out $(THESE), $(FROM_THESE))
```

## Pattern Rule

```Makefile
# any file stem.o from another file stem.c.
%.o : %.c
```

## Example

```Makefile
# This is a comment line
CC=g++
# CFLAGS will be the options passed to the compiler.
CFLAGS=-c –Wall
OBJECTS = main.o hello.o factorial.o
all: prog
prog: $(OBJECTS)
    $(CC) $(OBJECTS) -o prog
%.o: %.cpp
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $<
clean:
    rm -rf *.o
```
